Course project in python

This is a game that improves players' driving skills by teaching them good coordination, quick reactions and good orientation. The application itself consists of three sub-games. When the code is executed, a window opens from which users can choose which of the three sub-games to play.
 -> The first game consists of 10 levels that gradually increase in difficulty. After the 3rd level, bonuses appear in the form of Snickers or branded sausages, which respectively give additional points.
 -> The second game simulates driving on a highway, where the goal is to overtake other cars without hitting them. Time is measured and the record is recorded.
 -> The third game is a maze. It also consists of 10 levels with scaling difficulty. The player starts in the upper right corner and his goal is to reach the Snickers.
